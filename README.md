# Vesprisc

The above verilog design and testbench provides the VESP CPU architectures which has been modeled with IR(instructure register),PC(Program Counter), MAR(Memory Address Register), MDR(Memory Data register), IX (Indexing register), and two external registers. 

Two VESP CPUs have been modeled based on the opcode analysis bits
Vesp 1.0 contains 3 bit instruction opcodes
vesp 2.0 contains 4 bit instruction opcodes
